# Parallel Programming with OpenMP and C

This repository contains several projects that demonstrate parallel programming using OpenMP and the C programming language. OpenMP is a library for parallel programming that provides a set of directives and functions for parallelizing C code. The projects in this repository aim to test the performance of several algorithm through the use of various parallelization techniques. I ran experiments to compare the parallel techniques among each other. 

**Parallelized Algorithms:**
* Matrix Multiplaing
* Integers Summation
* Approximating PI 
* Sorting
